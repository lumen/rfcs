# Lumen RFCs

Request for Comment for Lumen

## What this not

* RFCs for changes to *existing* Lumen community projects. You should open issues in those specific project repos rather than discuss feature requests, bugs, vision, etc... of existing projects here.

## What this is

* Open discussion on the viability and best path forward on any projects that will interact with, enhance, or otherwise live within the greater Lumen ecosystem
* A centralized historical discussion for the Lumen ecosystem for reference by current and future community contributors

## How to submit an RFC

We do not accept Pull Requests in this repository. This is only an issue tracker. When opening a new issue please respect the guidelines in the Issue Template as this will help best to normalize the discussion and get the quickest feedback.

## Stale RFCs

Periodically we will triage open issues an close any that have not had activity in a while. As we evolve we hope to better define the criteria for close issues and communicate this to the community.

### Why close stale issues?

The open issue tracker can quickly become noise. We want to keep the signal value high.
